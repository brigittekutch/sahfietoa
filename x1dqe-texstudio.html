For various reasons (mainly to do with my work IT) I may have to do much more LaTeX work in Windows 10 than in Linux. I have been happily using emacs+auctex+reftex for years, but my experience with emacs in Windows has not been very satisfactory. So I'm simply looking for recommendations of a good LaTeX environment native to Windows 10. Options seem to be IDEs such as TeXmaker and TeXStudio, or an editor such as Atom.

Hi everyone! I've been writing my LaTeX source files in emacs and running `pdflatex` from a terminal in Ubuntu 16.04. My only annoyance is that it's hard to read the raw terminal output and hunt down warnings. Some IDE's can parse that output into a simple list of errors and warnings (I'm thinking specifically of Texmaker but I know that other IDE's do it, too) and I was wondering if anyone knows of something similar for my situation. I was hoping for an emacs package or a Gnome terminal. An integrated writing environment for creating LaTeX documents. 
I would like to be able to define shortcuts as something like "Shift+b+e" ? So far it only lets me use one letter and more letters could make it easier to remember them (for instance, if I want a shortcut for \begin{equation}) Context (if you wonder why I ask this): So far I've been defining macros like \newcommand{\be}{\begin{equation}}, and I've been told that it is a horrible practice, both for the readability of external people, and also because defining macros inside macros could. Hi, I'm considering get a PixelBook to replace my old Macbook Air. I'd love to know how is the experience with LaTeX on the PixelBook.

What is a good texstudio workflow (specifically wrt the bibliography) for easy submission to arxiv? Currently, I use bibtex for citations and have to upload my bbl file but arxiv is telling me they dont support bbl files of version 2.9 which is what texstudio gives me.

Hello, I use texmaker, and code with pdf preview is shown like this https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Texmaker_32_Ubuntu_Linux_1204.png/1200px-Texmaker_32_Ubuntu_Linux_1204.png is there any way to configure it so, that the code is above the pdf preview, so one can fit another window comfortably besides it on 16:9 monitor. Sorry for the noob question. Hi all, I'm a new latex user (although I've used overleaf a bit), and I'm trying to figure out a way to get a dark theme in TexWorks. I'm looking at a computer all day and and a black background with light text would be preferred. I can't find a way to do this in TexWorks - do I really have to download another editor to get a night mode? Thanks!! Edit: thank you everyone, I‚Äôm going to check out TexStudio. Apologies if the below doesn't lacks clarity as I have never come across an issue like this and I am unsure why it is working like this, or how one goes about fixing the issue. I've been using TeXStudio for years now because I like the formatting it uses, but came across a problem that has never cropped up before, but has been something I have noticed wanting to fix for a while that relates to the width of the text in the input .tex editor.
